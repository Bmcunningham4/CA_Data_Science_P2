# Project Prompt 
Machine Learning/AI Foundations Porfolio Project
Bring together all the Machine Learning/AI Foundations skills into a portfolio project. Loads, inspect, clean and prepare your dataset for machine learning modeling using Python and Pandas and compile your results into a portfolio-worthy report.

# Project Description
After completing the Machine Learning/ AI Fundamentals course on CodeAcademy, this is my first data science project with free range on choosing my own dataset to analyse, and what to investigate. I found this dataset on Kaggle Called "Salary By Job Title and Country". After tossing between a few different ideas I decided it would be interesting to do a gender Pay gap analysis and see in which contexts it was most prominent! 

# Navigation of the Repository 
- Within the Data_Exploration folder there are 7 jupyter notebook files with data analysis in each respective category and 1 csv file where I obtained my data.
- The other data_visualisations file contains boxplots, bar graphs and contingency tables bringing all the data analysis to life!









# Planning..
Ideas of things I could Explore
1) Gender Pay Gap analysis!
2) Geographic Salary variations!
3) Predictive Modeling for salary!
4) Experience vs Salary! 

Gender pay gap analysis - Look across all the columns of data I'm given: Age, Country, Education Level, Job Titles, Race and Years of experience. 

To see in what contexts the Gender Pay group is most prominent
