#? Straight from CodeAcad, Project scoping:
"""
Let's plan this guy out: (Accoring to university of Chicago's Data Science scoping guide, 3 main compononets)

- Goals
- Data
- Analysis 

"""

#* Yikes this project is gonna be a lot harder because I have to find data online and no example to compare to woahhh

#? Collecting Data: (websites)
"""
data.gov ------- boring as bloody batshittt..
kaggle   ------- This has some interesting stuff!! NBA Stats, spotify.., animal condition..
data.world
awesomedata
Fivethirtyeight
Buzzfeed
UCI
"""

#? Potential Ideas:
"""
Kaggle #todo: A lot of these ones I could use for personal data science project another time!
- 2023 Holidays DataSet
- Salary by job title and Country #* Winner winner Chicken Dinner
- Animal Condition
- World's top-50 playlist musicality data
- Trending YouTube Video Statistics (last updated 4 years ago)
- Chess Game Dataset (Lichess)

The rest of the game below Kaggle look okay data.world looks like it's most AI orientated but in a do it for you sorta way.. 
& the others... look alright mostly github stashes
"""

#? Need to think of ideas to investigate not just what happens to this variable as this variable changes...
"""
I'm liking the look of the Salary by Job Title and Country dataset

Some Potential Ideas..
1. Gender Pay Gap Analysis 
    - Explore salary differences between genders across different job titles, countries and seniority levels. 
        Identify if there's a significant gap and in what contexts it's most prominant!

2. Experience vs. Salary
    - Analyse how years of experience influence salary across different job titles and countries
    - Is there a point of dimishing returns, where additional experience doesn't significantly impact salary,

3. Geographic Salary Variations
    - Check if certain regions offer higher salaries for specififc job titles
    - And if this alligns with cost of living indexes (Don't think given one of them so might have to find 1!)

4. #* Predictive modeling for Salary
        - Build a predictive model to forecast salaries based on factors like education level, years of experience, job title, country etc..
        - Dunno If I have the tools to do this but will give it a crack..

# Look at .png file!!!! That's how you get screenshots in here fam and can alter them and edit them innit
"""
Also wanted to note look at how cool the info is from that screenshot and how well the summary statistics are displayed at the top!!

Hopefully that can be a mini project for me machine learning algorithm to make all my photos position my head in the same spot
By recognising the position of the ice bath!!!
