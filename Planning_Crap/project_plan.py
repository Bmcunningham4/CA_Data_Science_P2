#? This time compared to first project, going to have some key differences!
"""
1) Going to include a lot more visualisations of the data, eg. using seaborn module!

2) Going to include multiple files with different things being investigated!
"""

#* 3 Files that I'm going to explore!
"""
1) Gender Pay Gap analysis!
2) Geographic Salary variations!
3) Predictive Modeling for salary!

4) Experience vs Salary! #? If I have time for this one but 3 is a good amount to aim for!
"""


#? notes, as I'm going:
"""
Should I make a file with all the basic analysis for all the stats..
eg. median salary for software eng..
    median salary for Australian...
    Then avg salary for an Australian..

#* But maybe once I've got all that ^^ Put it in nice tables to summarise it all
AND REMEMBER -- I'm not doing this for every basic possible stat I'm doing this for all the gender related stats!!


Don't need to do this crap below ...
That sorta crap and also do I include Lots of different dataframes made or do I just get that crap from the 1 main dataframe..


#? I'm struggling to read the currencies when their in form like 1238223 compared to 123,599 --- I also don't know what currency lol

"""

#todo: I'm up to here now.. I don't have to make it perfectly tidy now but was good to get rid of a lot of that clutter and will finish off at the end..
"""
#! Also this could take forever and ever which I don't necessarily want it to, so I'm just trying to do a really complete gender analysis, not weak lots of things..

From here I think I should do this..
1. Watch vid / look for examples on structure of projects..
2. Make a tables file with all tables in a row with headings before each one!
3. Make a data visualisation file inlcuding graphs etc.. have a think about whether chi-square stastic stuff is needed
4. Write a final lil summary what I found etc.. (little cause I don't really give a shit about this!!)
