Bring together all the Machine Learning/AI Foundations skills into a portfolio project. Loads, inspect, clean and prepare your dataset for machine learning modeling using Python and Pandas and compile your results into a portfolio-worthy report.


# Random side note, under resources there's a technique called:
Rubber Ducking-
Where you try to explain the problem to a friend / co-worker this often prompts you to figure it out!!
.. I reckon this will be helpful goat!


# Potentially change the name of this repository to Portfolio_project_CA_2 and other ones to follow this pattern..
Then explain more precisely in the readme what they actually are..



# It's good that I'll have all my commits in here 
I wonder if I need to explain why I didn't in my other one eg. worked on it in a different repository..

# Let's see if this get's added to the main branch..
(It's almost like I would have to delete all my table data and then re commit it.. for this to work..)
