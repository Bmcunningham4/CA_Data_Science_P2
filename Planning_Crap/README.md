# Random side note, under resources there's a technique called:
Rubber Ducking-

# Potentially change the name of this repository to Portfolio_project_CA_2 and other ones to follow this pattern..
Then explain more precisely in the readme what they actually are..



# It's good that I'll have all my commits in here 
I wonder if I need to explain why I didn't in my other one eg. worked on it in a different repository..
